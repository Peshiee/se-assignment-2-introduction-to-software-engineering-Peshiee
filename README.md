# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the  branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
software engineering differs from traditional progrsmming in that it is extended over the entire life cycle of the software from conception to msintenance.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
The SDLC is
1. Initiation- project goals are defined
2. Planning- Define scope, schedule, budget
3. Execution- Tasks are assigned and plan is implemented
4. Monitoring and control- performance report is done
5. Closure- the project is finalised
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile method ia an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development
The waterfall method is a linear and sequential approach of management nd software development.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile method has a quick response to change comparetd to waterfall method
Regular customer feedback is supported in the agile method but as for waterfall, it is difficult sice feedback is received at the end of the project.
Waterfall method has a clear structure and documentation compared to agile method.
Agile method is preferred when the project is complex and requires experimentation. Waterfall method on the other hand is preferred when there are strict deadline.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing- testing individual components or mdules of software
Intergration testing- testing between different components or subsystems
System testing- testing the entire system as a whole
Acceptance testing- testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.


Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?


Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
